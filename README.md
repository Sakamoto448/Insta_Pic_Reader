The purpose of these code is to collect the handles from a certain list. For this particular case I am collecting social media handles from a Social Media Account and creating a Excel sheet of all the capture Handles from the Followers and Liked List of posts.

This is currently being used for the Univeristy of Rio Grande Valley to capture our research subjects on there engagement on the research teams social medai account on a daily basis.

Why doing it on ScreenShots (SS)? THis is so that not only we can capture the data but also have a tangigle piece of evidence if that list as well apoart from using other methos to scalp the data from instagram itself.

# Future Updates: 
       - Capture All post data (Poster, Post Description, Post Likes, Post Comments, Commenter Likes, Commenter Reply Tree)
       - Capture Story Data (Polls, Replies, etc...)
